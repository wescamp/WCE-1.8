#  Welcome to Wesnoths Collaborative Editor
#  ----------------------------------------
#
#  This is an online editor for wesnoth maps.
#
#  Credits:
#  --------
#  original-idea: grrr
#  additional-ideas: boucman, tsr
#  implementation: tsr
#  forum-thread: http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=27737
#
#  How to use:
#  -----------
#  1. Edit the scenario file of the scenario whos map you'd like to edit.
#  2. Paste the following code somewhere (safest at the beginnig) inside the [multiplayer]-tags.
#       {~add-ons/WCEv2/}
#  3. Load up a new multiplayer game with that scenario.
#  4. Start editing away! ;)
#
#
#  ToDo:
#  -----
#  - Wait for a new dev-release and enable the terrain-help
#  - Create some documentation
#
#
#
#
#
#  The plan
#  --------
#
#  (Status of each of the below items is showed in % of completion)
#
#  01.(090%) Allow the players to alter specific terrain hexes
#  02.(050%) Create a shortcut to the terrain-help 
#  03.(100%) Allow the players to save their maps
#  04.(100%) Allow the player to move units
#  05.(000%) Allow the player the spawn specific units (with specific traits) at specific locations
#  06.(100%) Allow the players to load maps
#  07.(000%) Allow for translations
#  08.(100%) Allow to store specific game states (units, gold, village-ownership, ToD, current turn) - with or without terrain changes
#  09.(100%) Allow to load the above mentioned game states
#  10.(000%) Bugs, ugly code, limitations, etc
#  11.(000%)
#  12.(000%)
#
#
#
#  01.(095%) Allow the players to alter specific terrain hexes
#  ---------------------------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(090%) Create a menu system - based on the editor groups - for all terrains
#           - not sure if all relevant terrains are present
#  2.(100%) Create an option to enter terrain-codes instead of using the above menu
#  3.(100%) Allow to set ownership of villages
#
#
#  02.(050%) Create a shortcut to the terrain-help 
#  -----------------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(050%) Create a menu item to access the help
#           - the code is there but doesn't seem to work
#                UPDATE: apparently boucman forgot to commit the patch, now it is commited for future releases
#
#
#  03.(100%) Allow the players to save their maps
#  ----------------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(100%) Give up, and let the players save the map using the "Save map" main-menu option ;)
#
#
#  04.(090%) Allow the player to move units
#  ----------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(100%) Create a menu item (active on empty hexes) to move the last selected unit there 
#  2.(000%) If the new location is a village: take control of it.
#
#
#  05.(000%) Allow the player the spawn specific units (with specific traits) at specific locations
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(000%) Come up with an  idea for a UI
#
#
#  06.(100%) Allow the players to load maps
#  ----------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(100%) Let the players start a new game with the already saved map as per point 3 above ;)
#
#
#  07.(000%) Allow for translations
#  --------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(000%) Add the text-domain stuff
#  2.(000%) Mark all user-visible strings as translatable
#
#
#  08.(090%) Allow to store specific game states (units, gold, village-ownership, current side turn, ToD, terrain changes)
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(100%) Store all the units
#  2.(100%) Store the gold for each side
#  3.(100%) Store all the villages
#  4.(100%) Store the current side turn
#           - I can't make sure that the correct side is in turn so only the first canrecruit=yes side can store snapshots
#  5.(100%) Store the current ToD
#  6.(060%) Store the current terrain changes (in relation to the original map)
#           - somehow it doesn't seem to work 100%, I don't know if it is store or restore related
#
#
#  09.(090%) Allow to load the above mentioned game states
#  -------------------------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(100%) Restore all the units
#  2.(100%) Restore the gold for each side
#  3.(100%) Restore all the villages
#  4.(100%) Restore the side turn
#           - I can't make sure that the correct side is in turn so only the first canrecruit=yes side can restore snapshots
#  5.(100%) Restore the current ToD
#  6.(060%) Restore the current terrain changes (in relation to the original map)
#           - somehow it doesn't seem to work 100%, I don't know if it is store or restore related
#
#
#  10.(000%) Bugs, ugly code, limitations, etc
#  -------------------------------------------
#  Steps:
#  1.(100%) Put everything in one event instead of three
#  2.(100%) Get the side_id information in one place instead of both in terrain_menu and game_menu
#  3.(090%) Clean up the village owner menu_item
#           - it is cleaner but the macro depends on the environment of the calling code
#  5.(100%) Only the first "canrecruit=yes"-side can store and restore gamestates (this is to ensure integrity of gamestates
#  6.(100%) To save and load your maps you have to use the wesnoth main menu and save the new map over the old one (if you don't want to edit the config file before creating a new game with the map).
#  7.(100%) You have to edit starting positions manually
#  8.(100%) To preserve the correct ToD when restoring gamestates I manipulate the current turn so I would not try to use this on a scenario with fixed turn limit.
#  9.(100%) Please note that changing objectives, changed variable-values, unset variables, etc, wont be handled with (re)storing gamestates so you should probably only use this in straight "victory_when_enemies_defeated=yes"-scenarios
